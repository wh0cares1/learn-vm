# Building a Virtual Machine

This is a repository for learn [Building a Virtual Machine](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/courses/virtual-machine/) and its internals. My main goal is to have a deeper understanding of programming languages internals, especially the Javascript engine.

----- What I already did -----

----- What's next -----
1. (async fetch (key) ...)
2. Arrays: (class Array ...) or an array literal: (array 1 2 3)
3. Optimizing compiler: pre-evaluate expressions, const propagation, etc.
4. Value representation
	- Tagged union (current)
	- Tagged Pointer
	- NaN-boxing or NaN-tagging
5. Static vs Dynamic (current) classes vs Prototypes
6. JIT compilation - translate to native code at runtime
7. Etc
